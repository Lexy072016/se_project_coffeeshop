# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I added extra features to the checkbox like the image of the check mark and added the cursor pointer. I think it just made the experience better overall.
I would add some images of some of the food and beverage choices to the menu page to give the user a better idea of what products we have.
